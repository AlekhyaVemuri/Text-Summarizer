## Description

A Chrome plugin, built using Flask, leverages an OpenVINO backend to efficiently summarize any webpage via a URL or any PDF via an upload. The plugin utilizes Langchain tools for tasks such as text splitting and managing a vectorstore.

## Prerequisites

1. **Create a Conda Environment:**
   - Run the command:  
     `conda create -n llm python=3.11 libuv`

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Execute:  
     `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. **Download and Convert the Huggingface Model to OpenVINO IR Format:**
   - Log in to Huggingface:  
     `huggingface-cli login`
   - Generate a token from Huggingface. For private or gated models, refer to Huggingface Hub's documentation.
   - Convert the model using `optimum-cli`:
     ```
     optimum-cli export openvino --model meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf --weight-format int8 ov_llama_2
     ```

4. **Clone the Repository and Load the Extension:**
   - In Chrome Developer mode, use the "Load Unpacked Extension" option to add the plugin. Refer to Chromeâ€™s development documentation for further details.

## Sample Structure

   - Navigate to the backend folder:
     ```
     cd Quick-Gist/backend
     python server.py
     ```

2. **Open the Chrome Browser:**
   - Activate & Pin the loaded extension.
   
3. **Select an OpenVINO Model:**
